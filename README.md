# File Organizer
A simple automatic file organizer using [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) that monitors the specified directory for changes and organizes files based on its filetype.

## Updates
### Update 1
- Added default directory.
- Added a check function, which checks whether the folder is available or not. If not creates the folder.
- Made the directory selection OS-agnostic.

## Credits
Took inspiration from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCvI-K0Gp90&list=PLe2lWnS2pvv0ByURp9x6cNywegY2ei7Vt) by Internet Made Coder and added a little spin to it.
